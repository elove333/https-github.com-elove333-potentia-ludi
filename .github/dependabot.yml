      3. Automate `npm audit` with GitHub Actions

You can configure npm audit to run automatically during CI checks.

1. Add a GitHub Action for npm audit:

• Add the following to .github/workflows/npm-audit.yml:
name: npm audit
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
jobs:
  npm-audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run npm audit
      run: npm audit
