# Upgrade esbuild (0.21.5 → 0.27.3), Vite (5.x → 7.x), and Vitest (1.x → 4.x).

This PR upgrades the following dependencies:

1. **esbuild**: Upgraded from version 0.21.5 to 0.27.3.
    - This includes minor and patch upgrades with no significant breaking changes as per the [esbuild changelog](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/releases).

2. **Vite**: Upgraded from version 5.x to 7.x.
    - This major version upgrade introduces several new features and enhancements, as well as breaking changes. More details can be found in the [Vite changelog](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/releases).

3. **Vitest**: Upgraded from version 1.x to 4.x.
    - This major version upgrade improves performance and includes some breaking changes in the API. Refer to the [Vitest changelog](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/releases) for more information.

### Reasoning for This Change:
These upgrades aim to keep the project dependencies up-to-date, providing the latest bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features.

### Key Considerations/Risks:
- **Vite** 7.x introduces breaking changes that may require updates to project configuration files.
- **Vitest** 4.x changes the test configuration structure, which may need to be aligned with the updated documentation.

### Testing:
All changes have been tested locally to ensure compatibility with existing project requirements and workflows. Additional tests were conducted to verify that the application builds and functions as expected after the upgrades.
